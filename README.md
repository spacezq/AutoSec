Usage
To run the Auto_scanweb script, use the following command:

```bash
Copy code
./auto.sh <domain>
```
Replace <domain> with the target domain you want to scan. The script will perform the following actions:

Passive Enumeration: Subdomain enumeration using multiple tools.
Vulnerability Scanning: Scan live domains and identified parameters using Nuclei.
Data Export to Burp Suite: Sends all discovered URLs to Burp Suite for further manual testing.
Example:
```bash
./auto.sh example.com
```
The results will be saved in the respective folders created under the domain's directory.
